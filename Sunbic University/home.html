            <p id="title-1-explanation">Sunbic University is a private university in Indonesia. 
                The main campus of the university is located at Alam Sutera, South Tangerang. Most of its campuses are located within the 
                area of Greater Jakarta Region. It also has campuses at Bandung and Malang. <br><br> Sunbic University originally 
                evolved from a computer training institute, Modern Computer Course, which was founded on 21 October 1974. Along with the 
                development, the Modern Computer Course later developed into Computer Engineering Academy (ATK) on July 1, 1981. 
                The Academy offers informatics and informatics management education. Three years later on 13 July 1984 ATK achieved 
                registered status and the name changed to AMIK Jakarta. On July 1, 1985, AMIK opened a course in accounting 
                computerization. AMIK began to use the name Sunbic on 21 September 1985. <br><br> AMIK was awarded the best computer academy 
                award from the Ministry of Education and Culture on March 17, 1986. AMIK Sunbic then formed STMIK 
                (College of Informatics and Computer Management) Sunbic on July 1, 1986. The institute then offered undergraduate 
                study programs (S1) in informatics management and informatics engineering. <br><br> On November 9, 1987, AMIK Sunbic 
                joined STMIK Sunbic to form an educational institution offering a diploma study program (D3) and strata 1 (S1). 
                STMIK Sunbic gained an equal status for all courses on March 18, 1992. STMIK Sunbic then opened a 
                postgraduate program of information systems management, first in Indonesia on May 10, 1993. <br><br> </p>
